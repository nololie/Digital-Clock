# Digital-Clock
### Python upskilling digital clock project.

A simple project from a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4bApAhEIM), improved and updated as I test my skills and practise.

In this project I created a digital clock with a gui in python. 

## Get started

To run this project, you first need to download or rather just have the code in the file **Guied digital clock.py** in a python file and you also need to have python installed. I am not quite sure which version can be required but I recomend python 3.10.5 since I used it to buid and run this project.
